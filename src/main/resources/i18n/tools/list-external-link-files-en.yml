description: |
  List files and directories from the external_link directory (linked_external folder). This tool provides access to directory
  listings in the external folder that can be accessed across all sub-plans within the same execution context.
  
  **Prerequisites:**
  - The external folder must be configured in system settings before using this tool
  - Set 'lynxe.general.externalLinkedFolder' in system settings to point to your external folder
  - The external folder link will be automatically created when a plan starts (if configured)
  - If external_link is not configured, operations will fail with a clear error message indicating the configuration is missing

  Lists both files and directories in the specified path within the external_link directory.
  Shows file sizes in human-readable format (B, KB, MB, GB).
  Can list directories at root level or in subdirectories of the external folder.
  Files and directories are sorted alphabetically.
