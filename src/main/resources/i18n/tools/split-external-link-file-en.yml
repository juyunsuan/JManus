  Split text files (markdown, code, HTML, etc.) into smaller pieces in the external_link directory (linked_external folder). This tool helps break down
  large text files into manageable chunks while preserving content completeness.
  
  **Prerequisites:**
  - The external folder must be configured in system settings before using this tool
  - Set 'lynxe.general.externalLinkedFolder' in system settings to point to your external folder
  - The external folder link will be automatically created when a plan starts (if configured)
  - If external_link is not configured, operations will fail with a clear error message indicating the configuration is missing

  Important: Files are read from the external_link directory (linked_external folder).
  For example, to split a file in external_link, use file_path "file.md" or "subdir/file.md".
  
  The file is split into smaller pieces (as evenly as possible by lines). By default, files are split into 10 pieces.
  In principle, you should keep each split file within 20000 characters.
  Output files are saved in the same directory as the source file, named with index prefix: 0-filename.ext, 1-filename.ext, etc.
