  Create new files or overwrite existing files completely in the external_link directory (linked_external folder).
  This operator provides access to files in the external folder that is linked to the root plan directory.

  **Prerequisites:**
  - The external folder must be configured in system settings before using this operator
  - Set 'lynxe.general.externalLinkedFolder' in system settings to point to your external folder
  - The external folder link will be automatically created when a plan starts (if configured)
  - If external_link is not configured, operations will fail with a clear error message indicating the configuration is missing

  Keywords: external files, external_link, linked_external, external folder,
  external file write operations, write file, create file.

  Operation:
  - Create new files or overwrite existing files completely in external_link directory
    - file_path (required): Relative file path within external_link directory (filename or relative path, e.g., 'file.txt' or 'subdir/file.txt'). Parent directories will be created automatically if they don't exist.
    - contents (required): The complete content to write to the file. This will be the entire file content after the operation. If file exists, all previous content will be overwritten.
    - Creates new files if they don't exist
    - Completely overwrites existing files (all previous content is lost)
    - Automatically creates parent directories if they don't exist
    - MUST read file first before overwriting to prevent accidental data loss
    - Prefer StrReplace for editing existing files when possible
    - Only use Write for creating new files or complete file rewrites

  Features:
  - Files created here are accessible by all sub-plans within the execution context
  - Automatically creates parent directories if they don't exist
  - Files are stored in the external folder linked to the root plan directory
