  Count the total lines and characters in a given file in the external_link directory (linked_external folder). This tool provides detailed statistics
  about text-based files including line count, character count (with and without newlines),
  word count, and file size.
  
  **Prerequisites:**
  - The external folder must be configured in system settings before using this tool
  - Set 'lynxe.general.externalLinkedFolder' in system settings to point to your external folder
  - The external folder link will be automatically created when a plan starts (if configured)
  - If external_link is not configured, operations will fail with a clear error message indicating the configuration is missing

  Important: Files are read from the external_link directory (linked_external folder).
  For example, to count a file in external_link, use file_path "file.md" or "subdir/file.md".
  
  Supported file types: All text-based formats including markdown, code files, HTML, JSON, YAML, etc.
  
  The tool provides the following statistics:
  - Total Lines: Number of lines in the file
  - Total Characters (including newlines): File size in bytes/characters
  - Total Characters (excluding newlines): Sum of all line lengths
  - Total Words: Number of words (split by whitespace)
  - File Size: File size in bytes
