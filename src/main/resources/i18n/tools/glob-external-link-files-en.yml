  Find files matching a glob pattern in the external_link directory (linked_external folder). This tool searches for files matching the specified glob pattern in the external folder,
  with results sorted by modification time (most recently modified first).
  
  **Prerequisites:**
  - The external folder must be configured in system settings before using this tool
  - Set 'lynxe.general.externalLinkedFolder' in system settings to point to your external folder
  - The external folder link will be automatically created when a plan starts (if configured)
  - If external_link is not configured, operations will fail with a clear error message indicating the configuration is missing
  
  Fast pattern-based file discovery using glob patterns.
  Supports standard glob wildcards (*, **, ?, etc.).
  Recursive search by default (patterns auto-prefixed with **/).
  Patterns NOT starting with "**/" are automatically prepended with "**/" to enable recursive searching.
