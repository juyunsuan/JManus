  Perform exact string replacement in existing files in the external_link directory (linked_external folder).
  This operator provides access to files in the external folder that is linked to the root plan directory.

  **Prerequisites:**
  - The external folder must be configured in system settings before using this operator
  - Set 'lynxe.general.externalLinkedFolder' in system settings to point to your external folder
  - The external folder link will be automatically created when a plan starts (if configured)
  - If external_link is not configured, operations will fail with a clear error message indicating the configuration is missing

  Keywords: external files, external_link, linked_external, external folder,
  external file replace operations, replace text, StrReplace.

  Operation:
  - Perform precise, targeted edits without rewriting entire files in external_link directory
    - file_path (required): Relative file path within external_link directory (filename or relative path, e.g., 'file.txt' or 'subdir/file.txt'). File will be auto-created if it doesn't exist.
    - old_string (required): The exact text to find and replace. Must match file content exactly (including all whitespace, indentation, line breaks). Must be unique in the file - if multiple occurrences exist, provide more context to make it unique.
    - new_string (required): The text to replace it with. Must be different from old_string. Can be an empty string to delete content.
    - CRITICAL: old_string must be unique in the file (will fail if multiple occurrences found)
    - Matches are case-sensitive and whitespace-sensitive (must match exactly including indentation)
    - Only replaces the first (and only) occurrence

  Features:
  - Files created here are accessible by all sub-plans within the execution context
  - Exact matching ensures precise replacements
  - Uniqueness validation prevents accidental multiple replacements
  - File will be auto-created if it doesn't exist
  - Files are stored in the external folder linked to the root plan directory
