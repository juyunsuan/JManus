  Read file contents from the external_link directory (linked_external folder). This operator provides access to files
  in the external folder that is linked to the root plan directory.

  **Prerequisites:**
  - The external folder must be configured in system settings before using this operator
  - Set 'lynxe.general.externalLinkedFolder' in system settings to point to your external folder
  - The external folder link will be automatically created when a plan starts (if configured)
  - If external_link is not configured, operations will fail with a clear error message indicating the configuration is missing

  Keywords: external files, external_link, linked_external, external folder,
  external file read operations, external directory access.

  Main operation:
  - Read file contents from external_link directory with optional offset and limit parameters
    - path (required): The file path to read within the external_link directory
    - offset (optional): Line number to start reading from (1-based). Only use for very large files
    - limit (optional): Number of lines to read. Only use for very large files
    - bypass_limit (optional): If true, bypasses the 300-line limit for full file reads. Use with caution for very large files
    - Output format: LINE_NUMBER|LINE_CONTENT (line numbers are right-aligned, padded to 6 characters)
    - Returns "File is empty." if file exists but is empty
    - Best practice: Read full files unless extremely large (omit offset and limit). For files exceeding 300 lines, use bypass_limit=true or specify offset/limit

  Features:
  - Supports text files in the external folder
  - Files in external_link directory are accessible across all sub-plans within the execution context
  - Can read multiple files in parallel for better performance
  
  ## File Reading Best Practices:
  Prioritize small-scope information retrieval:
  1. **Use EnhancedGrep**: For searching specific patterns or keywords in files (most efficient for targeted information)
  2. **Use offset/limit**: Read specific line ranges when you know approximate location
  3. **Use bypass_limit**: Only when you cannot obtain needed information through grep or limited reading, and you need the entire file content
